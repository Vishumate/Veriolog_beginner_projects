# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog  

## üîç Overview  
This project implements a **16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in Verilog. The ALU supports **arithmetic and logical operations**, including addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations. It also provides status flags such as **sign, zero, and carry**.

## ‚ö° Features  
- **Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR operations**  
- **Left and Right shift operations**  
- **Status flags:**  
  - **Sign**: Indicates if the result is negative  
  - **Zero**: Set if the output is zero  
  - **Carry**: Set if there's an overflow in addition/subtraction  
- **Verilog testbench included**
