# Verilog Beginner Project

## Overview

This project serves as an introduction to Verilog, focusing on fundamental digital design concepts through practical implementations. It includes various combinational and sequential circuits, leading up to more advanced designs.

## Completed Projects

1. **16-bit Multiplier (mul1)**

   - Implements a **shift-and-add multiplication algorithm**.
   - Uses **bitwise shifting and accumulation** to compute the product.
   - Verified with a testbench to ensure correct functionality.

2. **3-bit Pattern Detector (pattern\_detector1)**

   - Implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.
   - Detects three consecutive `1`s in a serial data stream.
   - Uses **state transitions** to track input sequences.

3. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**

   - Supports **addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and shift operations**.
   - Uses a **case statement** to select operations.
   - Outputs **zero flag and carry flag**.

## Upcoming Projects

1. **4-bit Counter**

   - Implements an **up/down counter**.
   - Uses **synchronous and asynchronous reset**.
   - Supports **enable and load functionality**.

2. **Shift Register**

   - Implements a **serial-in, serial-out (SISO) shift register**.
   - Explores **parallel load and shift operations**.
   - Useful for **data serialization and buffering**.

3. **FSM-based Traffic Light Controller**

   - Simulates a **real-world traffic light system**.
   - Uses **state transitions to control lights**.
   - Implements a **timing mechanism** for state durations.

4. **VGA Controller (Basic Graphics Output)**

   - Generates **video signals** for display output.
   - Uses **pixel clock synchronization**.
   - Introduces **memory-mapped video display concepts**.

## Tools and Environment

- **Simulator**: ModelSim (Basic Version),Â Vivado Simulator (XSIM).
- **Editor**: VS Code.
- **Future FPGA Testing**: Once resources are available, projects may be tested on an FPGA board.

## Goals

- Strengthen Verilog coding skills.
- Gain hands-on experience with **hardware description languages (HDLs)**.
- Build foundational knowledge for **FPGA and ASIC design**.
- Work towards more complex projects.

This document will be updated as more projects are completed. Stay tuned for progress!
